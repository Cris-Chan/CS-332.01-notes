> "What is an algorithm and why do we study it?"

An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem
i.e. for obtaining a required output for a legitimate input in **finite amount of time**

### Assignments
solutions will be submitted online as pdf, eps, or png files
or as source code files

## What is an Algorithm?
- Definite : steps precisely defined (unambiguous)
- Effective : Produces desired result
- Finite : Ends, with resonable amount of time

Approximate vs exact solutions

## ways we can compare algorithms
- Efficiency
    - Time
    - Space
- simplicity on elegance
- Generality - range of problems that the Algorithm can solve

## Orders of growth (for input size n)
- 1
- log n
- n
- n log n
- n^2
- n^3
- n^4
- n^5
- 2^n
